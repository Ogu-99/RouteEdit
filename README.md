# RouteEdit
###### An editor for NSMBWii's RouteInfo.arc derived from NSMB2's routeInfo file editor

This is a fork of the NSMB2 RouteEdit, modified for the usage
of the NSMBWii `RouteInfo.arc`. The UI is adjusted to fit the
NSMBWii system, and anything not compatible with NSMBWii 
was removed.

Credits go to Explos for the original program and me
for modifying it.

See https://horizon.miraheze.org/wiki/Editing_the_Original_Maps
for a thorough documentation of the NSMBWii retail world map system.
